  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>I'm in the process of re-writing my website here. So don't panic! I'll have things up and running again soon. Thanks for visiting jessy.co.</p>
  <p>
    Most likely, some URLS will have changed however since I'm planning on having a section for blog posts and articles instead of grouping everything together.
    (no need to have all my random ranting fill up the site content.)
  </p>

  <p>
    You might be seeing double the links for things like in the header and the footer. Don't worry about that design is in rapid development so things will be
    placed here and there as I get things figured out and sorted.
