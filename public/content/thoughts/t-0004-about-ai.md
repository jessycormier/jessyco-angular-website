Look, I know AI is kind of controversial at the moment.

I want to write, but most of the time I get lost in the details of what I'm trying to say. I want to express my ideas, I want to present readers with something that's at least better structured, without me needing to take a few hours of editing.

If I can remove a major roadblock to publishing posts and writing content—if I can use AI to take my random babbling or typed-out nonsense and shape it into something readable and valuable—then that's a win.

A win for me, as someone who wants to write and present ideas.
And a win for you, the reader, who's just trying to get to the point of what I'm saying.

So for now, I have this really fun editor to help me in the writing world. They don’t ask for royalties—just all my data...
